Analyzing the English Premier League Season 2022/2023 

## Introduction
The dataset contains information about the full statistics from the English Premier League the top Professional football league in England and the biggest football league in Europe for the 2022/2023 season. This includes a comprehensive dataset and accompanying analysis of statistics in England. The dataset includes valuable information and data about Possession and Goal Scoring, the Effect of Home Advantage on Performance, Offensive Efficiency Analysis, Analysis of Fouls and Discipline, Comparing Passing Accuracy and Chances Created, Exploring Shots and On-Target Shots, Comparison of Possession and Passing Statistics. I used Excel for Data Analysis and Visualization.

## Problem Statement
I was trying to answer and find some answers concerning the English Premier League season and if there is a correlation between the statistics and outcomes that were produced during the season. The correlations I am trying to discover can be seen below:
1.	Comparing Possession and Goal Scoring: Is there a correlation between possession percentages and the number of goals scored by the home team? Is possession a significant factor in determining the outcome of the match?
2.	Offensive Efficiency Analysis: Can we determine which team had a higher efficiency in terms of shots on target? Are there any patterns in teams' ability to convert shots into goals?
3.	Comparing Passing Accuracy and Chances Created: How did the number of completed passes relate to the number of chances created?
4.	Comparison of Possession and Passing Statistics: Was there a relationship between possession and the number of completed passes?
5.	Exploring fan attendance: Who accounted for the highest percentage of fans that attended games for the 2022/2023 season?

## Data Analysis
The original data provided was incomplete and can be seen under the file section. The file is called **Premier_League.csv**. Some key information like stadium name, and attendance record so I had to get the information to fill and replace the empty cells. The cleaned and updated table can be seen under the file section with the name **modified_Premier_League_stats.csv**. To fully answer the problem statement and find some correlations between things and events, I had to make use of the SUMIFS() function, SUM() function and the AVERAGEIFS() function. These functions were used to better simplify and understand the original data. The new and better data was used to create my pivot table and can be seen in the file section by the file name **remodeled_Premier_League_stats.csv**.
