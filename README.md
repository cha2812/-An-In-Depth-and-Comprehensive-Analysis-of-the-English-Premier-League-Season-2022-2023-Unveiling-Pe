Analyzing the English Premier League Season 2022/2023 

## Introduction
The dataset contains information about the full statistics from the English Premier League the top Professional football league in England and the biggest football league in Europe for the 2022/2023 season. This includes a comprehensive dataset and accompanying analysis of statistics in England. The dataset includes valuable information and data about Possession and Goal Scoring, the Effect of Home Advantage on Performance, Offensive Efficiency Analysis, Defensive Performance Comparison, Analysis of Fouls and Discipline, Comparing Passing Accuracy and Chances Created, Exploring Shots and On-Target Shots, Set Pieces Analysis, Comparison of Possession and Passing Statistics, Correlation between Possession and Defensive Metrics, Impact of Substitutions, and Goalkeeper Performance Analysis. I used Excel for Data Analysis and Visualization.

## Problem Statement
I was trying to answer and find some answers concerning the English Premier League season and if there is a correlation between the statistics and outcomes that were produced during the season. The correlations I am trying to discover can be seen below:
1.	Comparing Possession and Goal Scoring: Is there a correlation between possession percentages and the number of goals scored by the home team? Is possession a significant factor in determining the outcome of the match?
2.	Effect of Home Advantage on Performance: Do home teams generally have a higher possession percentage and more goals compared to away teams? How does home advantage affect team performance in terms of shots, shots on target, and corners?
3.	Offensive Efficiency Analysis: Can we determine which team had a higher efficiency in terms of shots on target and blocked shots? Are there any patterns in teams' ability to convert shots into goals?
4.	Defensive Performance Comparison: How do the number of tackles, duels, saves, and blocked shots differ between the home and away teams? Does a team's defensive performance influence the match outcome?
5.	Analysis of Fouls and Discipline: Are there any trends in terms of the number of fouls committed by home and away teams? Does a team's discipline, indicated by the number of yellow and red cards, have an impact on the final result?
6.	Comparing Passing Accuracy and Chances Created: How accurate were the passes made by both teams? Did the team with higher passing accuracy also create more goal-scoring opportunities? How did the number of completed passes relate to the number of chances created?
7.	Exploring Shots and On-Target Shots: How did the number of shots and shots on target differ between the home and away teams? Did the team with more shots also have a higher number of shots on target?
8.	Set Pieces Analysis: How do the number of corners, free kicks, and offsides vary between the two teams? Are set pieces a significant factor in generating scoring opportunities?
9.	Comparison of Possession and Passing Statistics: How did possession percentages correspond to passing accuracy and the number of passes made by each team? Was there a relationship between possession and the number of completed passes?
10.	Correlation between Possession and Defensive Metrics: Is there a connection between possession and defensive metrics such as tackles, duels, and saves? Does higher possession lead to fewer defensive actions?
11.	Impact of Substitutions: Did the number of substitutions made by each team influence their overall performance? Did teams that made more substitutions perform differently compared to those that made fewer changes?
12.	Goalkeeper Performance Analysis: How did the number of saves made by the home and away goalkeepers differ? Did the team with more saves have a better chance of winning the match?
